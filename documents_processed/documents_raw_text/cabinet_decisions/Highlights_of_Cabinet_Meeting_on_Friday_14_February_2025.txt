Page 1 of 2 HIGHLIGHTS OF CABINET MEETING – FRIDAY 14 FEBRUARY 2025 1. Cabinet has taken note that the Central Water Authority (Dry Season) Regulations 2025 would be promulgated with effect from 17 February 2025 to enforce measures aimed at preventing water wastage, being given the precarious situation of our reservoirs. The regulations would impose restrictions on the use of water from the Central Water Authority network or from any other watercourse for “non-essential” activities such as washing vehicles, cleaning pavements or buildings, watering gardens or lawns, and filling of swimming pools, by using a hosepipe, sprinkler or pressure washer, without reasonable excuse. Additionally, to allow for flexible and prompt decision-making, the Water Resources Monitoring Committee would determine and review the frequency of irrigation of vegetables and crops based on water availability. Irrigation of sugarcane would remain suspended. Any person who would contravene the regulations would commit an offence and would, on conviction be liable – (a) in the case of a domestic consumer, to a fine not exceeding Rs50,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years; and (b) in any other case, to a fine not exceeding Rs200,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years. *** 2. Cabinet has taken note of the actions being undertaken by the Ministry of Environment, Solid Waste Management and Climate Change in respect of the formulation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) 3.0 for the Republic of Mauritius in line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The NDC 3.0 would include the outcomes of the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement, conducted from 2021 to 2023, whereby countries were encouraged to come up with more robust targets, aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C and taking into consideration the different national circumstances, their respective capacities as well as components for the adaptation sector. The Ministry of Environment, Solid Waste Management and Climate Change had, since December 2024, embarked on the preparation process for the development of the NDC 3.0 for the Republic of Mauritius, with the support of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), a German development partner. Three experts from the GIZ NDC Partnership Readiness Project Team would be in Mauritius for a one- week mission from 17 to 21 February 2025. The proposed NDC 3.0 would include bold measures to make Mauritius a climate-change resilient and low emission country in line with the Government Programme 2025-2029. *** Page 2 of 2 3.
