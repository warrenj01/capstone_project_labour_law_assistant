The main object of the Bill is to address new and emerging occupational and health risks due to major changes in the world of work. The Bill makes provision, inter alia, to – (a) ensure conformity with the fundamental conventions on occupational safety and health of the International Labour Organization; (b) set up the National Occupational Safety and Health Department to better manage occupational safety and health at national level; and (c) cater for changes associated with computerisation of the services of the National Occupational Safety and Health Department of the Ministry of Labour, Human Resource Development and Training. **** 2. Cabinet has agreed to drafting instructions being conveyed to the Attorney General’s Office with a view to repealing the existing National Computer Board Act and coming up with a new legislation for the setting up of a revamped institution with a new mission, vision and strategy, and which would become one of the pivotal organisations in Government’s endeavour to transform Mauritius into a well-connected and knowledge-based society through a culture of technology and innovation. The proposed mission of the new institution would be as follows - (a) to be an innovator and leader in pushing Mauritius towards a world class digital economy; (b) to lead and drive the ICT skills, knowledge and talent pool; and (c) to make technology widely accessible to everyone. **** 3.

Cabinet has agreed to the promulgation of the Consumer Protection (Control of Imports) (Amendment No. 5) Regulations 2022, whereby the moratorium period previously allowed in the Consumer Protection (Control of Imports) Regulations 2017 would be annulled such that the items ‘Rolling machine, other than rolling machines of industrial types, used to manufacture cigarettes’ and ‘“Roll Your Own Cigarette” papers’ would, henceforth, be prohibited goods, irrespective of their date of order or import. **** 5. Cabinet has taken note that the Registration Duty (Derogation from Liability to Duty) Regulations 2022 would be promulgated to clarify that a property in co-ownership, referred to in two sections of the Registration Duty Act where the first-time buyer exemption is provided, excludes a property owned jointly by a couple married under the regime of legal community of goods. This would ensure that each spouse benefits from the first-time buyer exemption once, as intended. **** 6. Cabinet has agreed to the sum of Rs70 million earmarked under the Bus Modernisation Scheme, for financial year 2022/2023, being used exceptionally to subsidise the acquisition of semi-low floor diesel buses, instead of electric buses only, as announced in Budget Speech 2022/2023. However, this would be subject to the semi low-floor diesel buses reaching Mauritius not later than 31 May 2023. The extension of the Bus Modernisation Scheme to conventional diesel buses would, therefore, provide bus operators with an adequate timeframe to plan for the electrification of their fleet. **** 7.

As a member of the OECD WGB, Mauritius would benefit from the immense experience of the OECD in fighting bribery. **** 9.
