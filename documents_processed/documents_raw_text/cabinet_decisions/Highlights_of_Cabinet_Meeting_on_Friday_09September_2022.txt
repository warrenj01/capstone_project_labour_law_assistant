A day of national mourning would be observed on the day of her funeral. The Mauritian flag would be flown at half-mast on all public buildings from sunrise to sunset on that day. An appeal would be made to the private sector to follow suit. On behalf of Government and the people of the Republic of Mauritius, a message of condolence has been sent to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. ***** 2. Cabinet has agreed to Mauritius ratifying two Protocols amending Articles 50(a) and 56 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation to increase the size of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council and membership of the Air Navigation Commission. ***** 3. Cabinet has agreed to the promulgation of - (i) the Fisheries and Marine Resources (Licence and Fees) Regulations which would review the licence fees payable by foreign owned Mauritian flagged longliners and purse seiners, and introduce licence fees for mid-water trawlers operating in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Mauritius and international waters; and (ii) the Fisheries and Marine Resources (Licence and Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2022, which would make an amendment with regard to the Footnote in the Second Schedule of the Fisheries and Marine Resources (Licence and Fees) Regulations 2013 to include the following – (a) There exists a dispute between Mauritius and France concerning Tromelin and its surrounding waters, including its EEZ. (b) While Mauritius unequivocally asserts its sovereignty over Tromelin and its waters, including its EEZ, the French authorities unilaterally purport to exercise jurisdiction, which is not recognised by the Government of Mauritius, over Tromelin and its waters. (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Chagos Archipelago and its waters are an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, over which Mauritius has sovereignty, as determined by the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion of 25 February 2019 and affirmed by a Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in its Judgment of 28 January 2021. ***** Page 2 of 6 4.

Cabinet has agreed to the procurement of 14 Tablets/Braille Notes for Special Education Needs learners with severe visual impairment at the secondary and tertiary school levels. ***** 8. Cabinet has agreed to the specifications of flour procured by the State Trading Corporation (STC) being amended to include additional enzymes in wheat flour Type A to enhance its quality to meet the needs of bakeries and expectations of consumers. The STC enlisted the services of a French consultant in May 2022 to, inter alia, review the existing specifications of wheat flour and to make recommendations to guarantee an optimum quality and regularity of wheat flour, even in tropical conditions, for bread production. The main recommendation is to amend the flour specifications to include additional enzymes, which would allow for the modification of the composition of the wheat flour Type A procured by the STC, to cater for the bakeries’ requirements in terms of tolerance and yield. ***** 9. Cabinet has agreed to exempt the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Pooled Procurement Programme for Medical Products from the Public Procurement Act. In 2017, the SIDS Ministers of Health expressed strong commitment to implement a system for the Pooled Procurement for medical products. In 2020, the SIDS Ministers of Health signed the SIDS Pooled Procurement Agreement virtually in the presence of the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Regional Director for Africa. The primary advantage of Pooled Procurement is cost reduction through economies of scale and collective negotiation. To further advance in the operationalisation of the SIDS Pooled Procurement Programme, there is need for this programme to be exempted from the Public Procurement Act. The Secretariat for the SIDS Pooled Procurement is currently hosted by WHO and would continue to be spearheaded by that organisation until around 2025 by which time, the SIDS Pooled Procurement would have its own Secretariat. ***** 10. Cabinet has taken note of the Report on the Lagoon Monitoring, in respect of quality of water and fish from Baie du Tombeau to Pointe aux Sables for period January 2019 to December 2020. A Monitoring Committee had been set up to monitor the water and seafood quality and make recommendations regarding the consumption of the seafood and the lagoon water quality for swimming purposes. Based on the results of seawater quality analysis undertaken from January 2019 to December 2020, the Monitoring Committee has made various recommendations. The lagoon monitoring is ongoing. ***** Page 4 of 6 11.
