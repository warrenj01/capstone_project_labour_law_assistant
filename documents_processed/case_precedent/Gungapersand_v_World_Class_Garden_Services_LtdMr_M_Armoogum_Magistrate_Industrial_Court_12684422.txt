I have duly considered the evidence on record, which has remained unrebutted in the absence of the Defendant. I find that the Plaintiff has established her claim on a balance of probabilities and that the Defendant owes her the following sums: (i) outstanding wages for the month of April 2020 (Rs 9,700. – Rs 5,100.): Rs 4,600. (ii) outstanding wages for the month of March 2021 (Rs 10,200. – Rs 8,000.): Rs 2,200. (iii) Balance of end-of-year bonus for the year 2021 (Rs 10,200. – Rs 6,000.): Rs 4,200. TOTAL: Rs 11,000. 4. Pursuant to section 27(6) of the Workers’ Rights Act, “where a claim of non- payment or short payment of wages is made to the Court, the Court may, where it thinks fit, order an employer to pay interest at a rate not exceeding 12 per cent in a year on the amount of remuneration due from the date of non-payment or short payment to the date of payment.” 5. In the light of the above, I order the Defendant to pay to the Plaintiff the sum Rs 11,000., together with interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the amount of remuneration due from the date of non-payment to the date of payment. I further order the Defendant to pay Rs 180. to the Plaintiff as compensation for expenses incurred by the Plaintiff in attending Court. 17 October 2024 M. ARMOOGUM Magistrate
