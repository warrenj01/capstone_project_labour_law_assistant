The methodology adopted to extinguish the fire comprised the breaking of the waste mass by means of excavators, cooling by application of water and covering the extinguished waste with soil. As at 28 November 2024 mid-day, around 19,250m2 had been covered completely. With the additional equipment and soil being received from the private sector, it was expected to increase the coverage rate to 2,000m2 per day to completely extinguish the fire by mid- December 2024. *** 2.
