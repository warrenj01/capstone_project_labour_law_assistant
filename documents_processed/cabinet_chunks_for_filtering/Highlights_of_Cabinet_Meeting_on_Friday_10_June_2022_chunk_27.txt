June. The slogan for World Blood Donor Day 2022 is “Donating blood is an act of solidarity. Join the effort and save lives”, A workshop would be held on 15 June 2022 targeting blood donation campaign organisers, NGOs and technical staff, to develop appropriate strategies for encouraging the young generation to become blood donors so as to overcome the drop in blood donation brought about by ageing blood donors and also to develop a Roadmap in situations of pandemic or other crisis.
