Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. The chosen motto and theme for this year are ‘Remember. Support. Act.’ and ‘Act for Low Speeds/Act for Low Speed Streets’, respectively, thus, emphasising on the reduction of traffic speeds which has the potential to prevent deaths and serious injuries. In this context, the Ministry of Land Transport and Light Rail would organise a series of activities in the third week of November in order to sensitise the population on road safety issues. **** 23.
