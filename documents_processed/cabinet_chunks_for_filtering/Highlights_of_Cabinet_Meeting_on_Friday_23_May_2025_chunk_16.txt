coordinate the implementation of the project for the setting up and operation of two regional Integrated Waste Processing Facilities on a Public-Private-Partnership basis. In order to allow for a high-quality waste stream to the Integrated Waste Processing Facilities, waste segregation at source would be fundamental through the provision of three bins to each household namely, one for organic wastes, one for recyclable materials and the third one for residual wastes to be sent to the landfill.
