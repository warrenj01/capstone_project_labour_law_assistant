The aim of the workshop would be to sensitise national stakeholders, both from the public and private sectors, on the state of play of the AfCFTA negotiations, in particular the forthcoming Protocol on Women and Youth in trade as well as inform them of opportunities and challenges arising on the African Continent under the Agreement. The study entitled “The Mauritian Strategy to leverage the opportunities in the AfCFTA”, would also be officially launched during the workshop. **** 26. Cabinet
